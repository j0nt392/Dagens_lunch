# Discord bot för Pia23 
A discord bot made for my Pia23 class of Pythonengineering AI students. This bot answers with the daily lunchmenu, schedule, weekly schedule, or a randomly picked programming-meme from rapidAPI.com.
If you are a student at Nackademin and would like to use this here are the steps:

- Create a discord bot at the developer portal at discord, use the TOKEN from there.
- You can use your own schedule from learnpoint
- For the memes you need a key from rapidapi.
- Check out my repository discordLLM for a version 2 of this one, using a LLM and vectordatabases. 

## Commands
- Dagenslunch 
- Dagensschema 
- Dagensklassrum
- Veckansschema
- Dagensmeme
